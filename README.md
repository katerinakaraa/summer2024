TH2LVAT- primary mirror assembly temperature
TH2LVAT file contains:
- lomb-scargle periodogram for 1 year of data

TH2PMAT- launch vehicle adapter temperature
TH2PMAT file contains:

Attitude Errors- mean pointing errors in x, y, and z directions over around 40 seconds (radians) & stdev of pointing errors
Attitude Errors file contains:
- me learning how to make a plot

Board Temperatures- temp at driver boards 1-5 & temp at acquisition boards 1-5
Board Temperatures file contains:
- loaded and made df

Mount Temperatures: temp at Telescope-Schmidt Corrector Mount (this helps to keep telescope pointed at target field)
Mount Temperatures file contains:
- loaded and made df

Optics Temperatures 1: temp on edge of Schmidt Corrector, on exterior of its mounting ring, edge of primary mirror, and exterior of primary mirror. The manual says that there should be 2 in each of the four places, but one on exterior of mounting ring is not listed in the file.
Optics Temperatures 1 file contains:
- lomb-scargle periodogram for 1 year of data (for a few of the parameters)

Optics Temperature 2: same as 1
Optics Temperature 2 file contains:
- loaded and made df for second half of data

Reaction Wheel Speeds: reaction wheel speeds for four wheels
Reaction Wheel Speeds file contains:
- lomb-scargle periodogram for 1 year of data (for a few of the parameters)

Telescope Temperatures 1: temp on schmidt corrector mounting ring (there is a Telescope Temperatures 2 file which is not loaded...)
Telescope Temperatures file contains:
- lomb-scargle periodogram for 1 year of data (for a few of the parameters)
